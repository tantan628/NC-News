# Tanis' News App

This project was created using React and Material UI. It is a mockup of a site where users can post articles and comment on theirs and others' articles. You can also use the app to delete comments made by the user you are logged in as. 

By default the app will be logged in as user 'testing'. To switch users you can click 'log in' at the top of the page and enter another user to switch to (try 'grumpy19' or 'tickle122').

A deployed version of the app can be found at:

https://tanis-nc-news.netlify.app/

## Running the App Locally

To run the app locally you will need to clone this repository using:

```
git clone https://github.com/tantan628/NC-News.git
```

Then cd into the respoitory, and use npm to install dependencies:

```
cd NC-News
npm i
```

Once this is complete, you can use the npm script 'start' to run the app. This will open a window in your default browser automatically:

```
npm start
```

## Requirements

The minimum version of node is:

``
Node.js 17.0.0
``

## Back End

The back end is powered by an API built by myself as part of the same Northcoders course. The repo for this API can be found here:
